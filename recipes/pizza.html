    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <ul>Flatbread Dough: A rectangular, rustic-style base that providesnice foundation</ul>
        <ul>Large Pepperoni Slices: Thinly sliced</ul>
        <ul>Mozzarella Cheese</ul>
        <ul>Tomato Sauce</ul>
        <ul>Red and Yellow Peppers</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>To recreate this rustic, pepperoni-topped flatbread, follow these simple steps to ensure a 
        crispy base and perfectly melted toppings:
    </p>
    <li>
        <ol>Prep the Dough and Oven</ol>
            <ul>Prehead your oven to 220 C. If you have a pizza stone, place it inside to get screaming hot.</ul>
            <ul>Stretch your dough into an oval shape on a piece of parchment paper or a floured wooden board.
                Aim for a rustic look rather than a perfect circle.
            </ul>
        <ol>Layer the Base</ol>
            <ul>Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small boarder for the crust 
                to puff up.</ul> 
            <ul>Scatter a generous amount of shredded mozzarella or torn fresh buffalo mozzeralla acros the sauce.</ul>
        <ol>Add the Toppings
            <ul>Place the large pepperoni slices so they slightly overlap, ensuring every bite gets some spice.</ul>
            <ul>Sprinkle the finely diced red and yellow bell peppers into the gaps between the pepperoni.</ul>
            <ul>Season with a pinch of dried oregano and a dusting of grated Parmesan cheese for that 
                extra savory kick.</ul>
        </ol> 
         <ol>Bake and Server
            <li>Slide the flatbread into the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling 
                and the edged of the crust are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Garnish with a final sprinkle of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes if you like a little heat.</li>
            <li>Plate it alongside a cluster of fresh cherry tomatoes on the vine.</li> 
        </ol>
    </li>
